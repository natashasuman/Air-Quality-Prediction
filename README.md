# Air-Quality-Prediction
In this project my main focus is to predict PM2.5 which is one of most deadliest pollutant particle. I have also performed data cleaning, data exploration and used different ML model to Predict PM2.5. 
I have used Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neigbour, Decision Tree, L1 and L2 Regularization, XGBoost and Random forest to implement this model. To Improve the accuracy of the model I have used the Hyperparameter tuning of random forest using Grid search, Random search and Crosss Validation.
I have also Used the RNN model called Long-Short Term Memory model(LSTM), it gives the best result out of all the models.
