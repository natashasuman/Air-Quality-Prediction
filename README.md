# Air-Quality-Prediction
In this project my main focus is to predict PM2.5 which is one of most deadliest pollutant particle. I have also performed data cleaning, data exploration and used different ML model to Predict PM2.5. I have used Linear Regression, Desicion Tree, KNN and Random forest to implement this model. I will also keep updating the file with better accuracy and also try to implement ANN for the data set.
